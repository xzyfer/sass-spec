DEPRECATION WARNING on line 14 of /sass/sass-spec-2/spec/libsass-todo-issues/issue_1709/input.scss: #{} interpolation near operators will be simplified
in a future version of Sass. To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote("#{$prefix}#{$transition}")

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
