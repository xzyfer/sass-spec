DEPRECATION WARNING on line 4 of /sass/sass-spec-2/spec/scss/function-names/input.scss: #{} interpolation near operators will be simplified
in a future version of Sass. To preserve the current behavior, use quotes:

  unquote("#{"hello" un}quote")

You can use the sass-convert command to automatically fix most cases.
